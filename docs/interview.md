Core Java: 
- Deep understanding of OOP (Object-Oriented Programming): Principles like encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction. 
  - Example: "Explain the difference between abstraction and encapsulation."
- Collections: List, Set, Map, Queue; differences, use cases, thread safety.
  - Example: "How does HashMap work internally?"
- Generics: Type safety, wildcards, bounded types.
  - Example: "What is PECS (Producer Extends, Consumer Super)?"
- Concurrency: Threads, synchronization, locks, Executor framework, atomic operations.
  - Example: "How do you avoid deadlocks in Java?"
- Streams: Functional programming, filter/map/reduce, parallel streams.
  - Example: "How would you use streams to process a list of objects?"
- Exception Handling: Checked vs unchecked exceptions, custom exceptions, best practices.
  - Example: "When should you use checked exceptions?"

JVM Internals:
- Garbage Collection: Types (G1, CMS, Parallel), tuning, GC logs.
  - Example: "How does garbage collection work in JVM?"
- Memory Management: Heap, stack, metaspace, memory leaks.
  - Example: "What is the difference between stack and heap memory?"
- Class Loading: ClassLoader hierarchy, custom class loaders.
  - Example: "How does JVM load classes?"
- Performance Tuning: Profiling, heap dumps, thread dumps, JIT compiler.

Frameworks:
- Spring (Boot, MVC, Data, Security): Dependency injection, REST controllers, data repositories, security filters.
  - Example: "How does Spring Boot simplify application setup?"
- Hibernate/JPA: ORM concepts, entity mapping, lazy vs eager loading.
  - Example: "What is the difference between Hibernate and JPA?"
- RESTful APIs: HTTP methods, status codes, statelessness, versioning.
  - Example: "How do you design a RESTful API?"

Design Patterns:
- Singleton, Factory, Observer, Strategy, Dependency Injection, etc.: Purpose, implementation, pros/cons.
  - Example: "When would you use the Strategy pattern?"

Testing:
- JUnit: Unit testing, assertions, test lifecycle.
- Mockito: Mocking dependencies, verifying interactions.
- Integration Testing: Testing across modules/services.
  - Example: "How do you test a Spring REST controller?"

Build Tools:
- Maven, Gradle: Dependency management, build lifecycle, plugins.
  - Example: "What is the difference between Maven and Gradle?"

Databases:
- SQL: Joins, indexing, normalization, transactions (ACID).
  - Example: "Explain ACID properties."
- NoSQL basics: Document, key-value, column, graph databases.
  - Example: "When would you choose NoSQL over SQL?"

Microservices:
- Architecture: Service decomposition, bounded context, API gateway.
- Communication: REST, gRPC, messaging.
- Resilience: Circuit breaker, retries, fallback.
- Monitoring: Metrics, logging, tracing.
  - Example: "How do you handle inter-service communication failures?"

DevOps:
- CI/CD: Pipelines, automated testing, deployment strategies.
- Docker: Containerization, images, volumes.
- Kubernetes basics: Pods, services, deployments, scaling.
  - Example: "How do you deploy a microservice using Docker and Kubernetes?"

Distributed Systems:
- CAP theorem: Consistency, Availability, Partition tolerance.
  - Example: "Explain the CAP theorem with an example."
- Messaging: Kafka, RabbitMQ; pub/sub, queues, durability.
- Caching: Redis, cache strategies (LRU, TTL).
  - Example: "How do you ensure cache consistency?"

Problem Solving:
- Algorithms: Sorting, searching, recursion, complexity analysis.
- Data Structures: Arrays, linked lists, trees, graphs, stacks, queues.
- System Design: Scalability, reliability, trade-offs.
  - Example: "Design a URL shortening service."

Soft Skills:
- Leadership: Guiding teams, decision-making.
- Code Review: Best practices, constructive feedback.
- Mentoring: Knowledge sharing, onboarding.
- Communication: Explaining technical concepts clearly.
  - Example: "Describe a time you resolved a conflict in your team."
